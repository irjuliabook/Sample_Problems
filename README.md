# Project Name

A brief description of what this project does and its goals.

## About The Project

[Add a more detailed description of what your project does, the problem it solves, and why it's important.]

## Project Files

This project contains one or more Jupyter Notebook files (with `.ipynb` extension) that include code, analysis, visualizations, and explanations.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine or in the cloud.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.x recommended) installed
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) installed

### Installation & Local Execution

**Method 1: Running Locally with Jupyter Notebook**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Install required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can create one using pip freeze > requirements.txt

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook
Your browser will automatically open (usually at http://localhost:8888). Now you can:

Navigate to the desired .ipynb file

Click on it to open

Run cells using Shift + Enter or the "Run" button

Method 2: Running in Google Colab (Cloud-Based - No Installation Required)
If you prefer not to install anything locally, you can run the notebooks directly in Google Colab:

Go to Google Colab

Click on File > Upload notebook

Go to the GitHub tab

Enter this repository's URL: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name

Select the notebook you want to open from the list

Ensure your runtime is connected to GPU/TPU if needed via Runtime > Change runtime type

Method 3: Using GitHub's Built-in Features
GitHub has native support for rendering .ipynb files statically:

Simply click on any .ipynb file in the repository

GitHub will display the notebook content including code, outputs, markdown, and images

Limitation: This is view-only mode. You cannot execute or modify the code directly on GitHub.

âœ¨ Enhanced Experience: One-Click Interactive Environments
For the best interactive experience, use these badges to open notebooks directly in executable environments:

https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg
https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg

Colab: Opens in Google Colab (requires Google account)

Binder: Creates a temporary executable environment from your repository (may take a few minutes to build)

Kaggle: Opens in Kaggle Notebooks (requires Kaggle account)

Note: Replace the URLs in the badge links with your actual username, repository name, and notebook file path.
